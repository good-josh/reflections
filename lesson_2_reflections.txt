What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new folder , .git , is created with metadata.
this tells git about the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate zone. It may prevent accidental commits. It allows for incremental update of what we want to commit.
