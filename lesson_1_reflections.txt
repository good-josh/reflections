It let me see only the changes, which are much smaller than the original.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can see how the program progresses.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros are that it prevents forgetting. Cons are that it may not always work as intended.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It increases the complexity of the system. The normal use case for them involves only one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat gives a number of metrics
git diff --numstat gives higher level metrics

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always go back! Even after saving.
